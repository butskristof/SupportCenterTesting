ASP.NET Core n-tier project to demo unit testing

## Introduction
This application was made as a demo in a research project for a course in .NET at the Karel de Grote University College. It was released as a working n-tier application to demo a full-stack ASP.NET Core application. For the research project, additional unit testing, dependency injection and reflection demos were added. 
The tests aren't all-inclusive as high code coverage was not the anticipated result of the research. The goal was to get an insight in the topics and demo as much interesting topics as possible. They are more focused on showing the capabilities of good unit testing. 

## Technology
.NET Core 2.1.504, EF Core, ASP.NET Core, xUnit. The project was developed with Rider 2018.3, and tested in Visual Studio Enterprise 2017.
